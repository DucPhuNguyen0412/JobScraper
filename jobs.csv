At Sasquatch, we know that strength training is the gateway to long term wellness; we know that good relationships are the precursor to long and fulfilling lives and we know that EVERYONE deserves the confidence that comes from feeling good in their own skin. That’s why we’ve designed a program that gives real, regular people what they need: results that last, confidence, and peace of mind knowing their health is “taken care of”. We also know that our members’ lives don’t begin and end in the gym, so we emphasize the importance of what they do in “the other 23” - all the hours that they aren’t with us in the gym. We want everyone to live longer, better lives and we know that ""better"" is different for everyone. That's why we make it our mission to get to know every member personally and find out WHY they are with us, so we can work together to find a path to their individual goals…because everyone deserves to feel strong."

Do you dream about sculpting not just bodies, but bank accounts? Well, we've got the job for you! **Job Title:** Senior Fitness Sales Consultant **Location:** Oak Park & Downtown Oak Park Orangetheory Fitness: Where Abs Are Made and Quotas Are Crushed **About Us:** At Orangetheory, we don't just transform bodies – we turn flab into fab and wallets into wonderlands. Our high-ticket program combines sculpting sweat sessions, accountability nagging (oops, we mean coaching), and custom nutrition that make kale taste like candy. We're on a mission to make six-packs more common than selfies, and we need your sales mojo to get there! **What You'll Do:** - Flex your sales muscles by consulting with potential clients that they absolutely need a workout experience that's practically life-changing. Just imagine the confidence boost of deadlifting your financial worries away! - Juggle more prospects than a clown at a balloon convention, managing a pipeline that's bigger than a bodybuilder's protein shake. - Set quotas on fire and watch them turn into flaming sales achievements. Cold calls? More like gold calls! - Collaborate with our clients and members to hold them accountable to attending 3-4 classes per week and making sure they are logging their meals **Requirements:** - Sales swagger that can rival a peacock's strut. Bonus points if you can close a deal while holding a dumbbell in one hand and a protein shake in the other. - Experience herding cats or managing something equally challenging – like a group of gym-goers during peak hours. - A penchant for acronyms: NASM, ACE, and even LOL. (We like trainers who can LOL their way through a tough workout!) - The ability to calculate commissions so high, you'll need a calculator with extra digits. - A commitment to making people fit, fabulous, and financially invested in their own well-being. This job does not involve training but that is an option. If chosen, part of the job responsibility is to work with clients virtually so remote work may be necessary **Perks:** - Commission? Sky's the limit! (Seriously, we don't even have a limit – it's more like a commission black hole.) - Unlimited classes, because if you're going to sell like a beast, you've got to workout like one too. - Access to the Orangetheory secret stash of motivational cat posters – because sometimes even personal trainers need a pep talk.
